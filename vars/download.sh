# https://github.com/HariSekhon/Jenkins/blob/master/vars/download.sh

# Downloads and replaces existing groovy files in the local directory with the latest function/pipeline files from HariSekhon/Jenkins if they exist upstream
#
# This allows one to maintain a local private copy of select functions, and get any updates periodically if wanted
#
# This is not as automated as running a direct fork which has 1 button sync and 1 button Pull Requests
# - you will need to git diff and commit yourself, and also correct any divergence by hand, but this was requested by one client for more control
#
# Usage:
#
#   cd to your repos library repo's vars/ directory, then run:
#
#       cd vars/
#
#       curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HariSekhon/Jenkins/master/vars/download.sh > download.sh && chmod +x download.sh
#
# Download or update any number of functions you want, given as their groovy filenames as you see in the HariSekhon/Jenkins repo::
#
#       ./download.sh argoDeploy.groovy
#
# Or run without any args to search for every *.groovy file in the local directory under vars/ and, if available in HariSekhon/Jenkins repo, overwrite it with the latest version from GitHub
#
#       ./download.sh
#
# This will first check for a local checkout at checkout path $checkout (~/github/jenkins), which makes development easier and can also be used to override using local forked function copies if available
